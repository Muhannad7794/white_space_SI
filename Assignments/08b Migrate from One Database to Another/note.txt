As this assignment's concern is database migration, I am also using the code
and the project from assignment 04b.
This is because the requirements of applying migration between two databases
and creating a migration script is already included in there.
The project is built with Django, which has its own migration protocol included.
The migration happens through modeling the database structure in models.py then
applying this structure on the database using Django's migration commands:
"python manage.py makemigrations"  &  "python manage.py migrate"
Django uses Sqlite, a file based database as its default database.
The database inherits the structure modeled in models.py,and the migration 
script included here in this folder.
However, the project is using a MySQL database hosted on Azure, which adds a 
further layer of migration to the project, as another migration process is 
applied here to migrate from SqLite to a closed hosted RDBMS database.
The migration script registers and creates new authentication and administration
tables in addition to the custom made tables structured by the Django models.
This does not only document the migration process, but also documents any 
admin/user operations, in case the project implements any multi access level
principles to manage and access the database.
