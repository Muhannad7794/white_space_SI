# Delivery Plan

All assignments are included in the general directory "Assiingments"

The script of each assignment, along with its data files are placed in separate directories.

Each directory is named after the assignment it is containing.
The name of the assginment matches the way they are named in the course's Github repo.

PS: I wrote the code for both servers in python beccause I am really not strong at javascript. but I used django for one server and fastapi for the other, in order to accomplish the required tech diversity.
